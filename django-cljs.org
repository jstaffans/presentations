#+Title: Django + ClojureScript = ❤

* Bret Victor on interactive programming

** What is the ideal environment for ideas to grow?

** Creators need an immediate connection to what they are creating

* ClojureScript

** Clojure dialect that compiles to JavaScript

** Functional

** LISP 

*** 1 + 1                    ->  (+ 1 1)

*** print("Hello!")          ->  (print "Hello!")

*** [1,2,3].map((x) => {     ->  (map inc [1 2 3])
***   return x + 1;
*** })

** Interactive -- close to Bret Victor's demo!



* ClojureScript: technical overview
  
** Designed for hosting: easy inter-op with JavaScript

** Uses Google Closure compiler

** Rich standard library

** Dynamically typed 

*** Has a powerful specification library in clojure.spec: 
 https://clojure.org/about/spec

** Immutable data structures 

*** Append item to vector:

***   (conj [1 2 3] 4)  ;; [1 2 3 4]

***   -> Produces a _new_ vector
***   -> Uses structural sharing to make it _fast_
***   -> Great fit for React, redux pattern

** CSP through core.async library

*** "Communicating Sequential Processes"
*** Similar to Go, django-channels
*** Solution to "callback hell"



* ClojureScript totally rocks the frontend!

** Clojure for the backend is a harder sell

*** JVM is unfamiliar

*** No monolithic framework like Rails, Django

*** Other choices not as broken as JavaScript 



* django-cljs-loader

** Inspired by django-webpack-loader

** Transparent ClojureScript integration for Django
