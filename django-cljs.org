#+Title: Django + ClojureScript = ❤

* Bret Victor on interactive programming

 - What is the ideal environment for ideas to grow?

 - Creators need an immediate connection to what they are creating

* ClojureScript

** Clojure dialect that compiles to JavaScript

** Functional

** LISP 

   ~1 + 1                    ->  (+ 1 1)~

   ~print("Hello!")          ->  (print "Hello!")~

   ~[1,2,3].map((x) => {     ->  (map inc [1 2 3])~
     ~return x + 1;~ 
   ~})~

** _Interactive_

   * In the same vein as Bret Victor's demo
   * Much better than similar efforts for React, Angular 



* ClojureScript: technical highlights
  
** Designed for hosting: easy inter-op with JavaScript

** Uses Google Closure compiler

** Rich standard library

** Dynamically typed (has runtime contracts though)

** Immutable data structures 

   * Append item to vector:

     ~(conj [1 2 3] 4)~     

     -> Produces a _new_ vector ~[1 2 3 4]~
     -> Uses structural sharing to make it _fast_
     -> Great fit for React, redux pattern

** CSP through core.async library

   * "Communicating Sequential Processes"
   * Similar to Go, django-channels
   * Solution to "callback hell"



* ClojureScript totally rocks the frontend!

** Clojure for the backend?

   * JVM is unfamiliar

   * No monolithic framework like Rails, Django

   * Other choices not as broken as JavaScript 



* django-cljs-loader

** Inspired by django-webpack-loader

** Transparent ClojureScript integration for Django

 Short demo ...

* Final words

 Space ships to Mars will use LISP, so better learn it now!
